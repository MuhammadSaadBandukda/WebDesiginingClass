# 📌 HTML Assignments

Dear Students,  
You have **two assignments**. Each one is based on a screenshot.  
👉 Look carefully at the screenshots and write the **HTML (and very basic CSS where required)** code to produce the same result.  
👉 Do **not use semantic tags** (`<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<article>`).  
👉 Do **not use tables**.
